# Java--Snake-Game
The game is built using Java programming language and involves the use of Java's built-in graphics library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the game.
The use of Java built-in libraries make the work-load small and efficient.
It is one of the old-time classics where the snake grows in size whenever it eats an egg and appropriate algorithms are provided to prevent the snake leaving the 
boundaries or trying to eat its own tail.
